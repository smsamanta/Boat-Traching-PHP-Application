Need to create a simple web application using PHP MYsql that tracks boats and their owners for a local marina.

The applicationmust include basic page navigation to allow the user to move between all pages that are accessible by the user.

You should allow a user to:

User registration
User Login
Admin
    browse a list of the various boats being moored
    view the details on a specific boat
    add new boats including an image of the boat
    edit and delete existing boats
